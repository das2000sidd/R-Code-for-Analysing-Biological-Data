# R-Code-for-B-KUL-I0P16B
This is the code for a project which demonstrates application of machine learning algorithms for speech data from Parkinson's Disease patients.
The objective is to determine if speech data can be used to develop a noninvasive method for Parkinson's Disease diagnosis.
The machine learning algorithms used were:
Bagging
Linear Discriminant Analysis
Logistic regression
Decision Tree
Random Forests
The dataset can be obtained from here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinson+Speech+Dataset+with++Multiple+Types+of+Sound+Recordings
